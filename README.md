# HyakusenrenmaTestTask

Test task for Hyakusenrenma

## Getting Started

Some necessary steps to complete, before running the project.

### Prerequisites

We need to have npm running on our machine. If not, please install node.js. As for demonstration purposes I am using node.js server.

### Installing

In order to prepare the project, we need to execute:

```
npm install
```

Then, after all necessary libs have been installed, execute:

```
gulp serve
```

This will compile our sass code, and run a server instance.
